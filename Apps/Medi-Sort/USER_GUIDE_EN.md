## 🏥 At the Japanese Clinic

When the interview is finished, the AI will generate a **"Medical Note" (Japanese Card)**.

### 1. Show the Screen
When you enter the doctor's room, **show your phone screen directly to the doctor**.
The note is written in professional Japanese medical terms.

### 2. Important Tips for Tourists 🇯🇵

## ⚠️ Emergency (In Japan)

If you have life-threatening symptoms, **dial 119** immediately.

*   **119** = Ambulance / Fire (Free of charge)
*   **Note:** "911" or "999" does **NOT** work in Japan.

### When calling 119:
1.  Say **"Medical"** or **"Kyukyu"**.
2.  Say **"Ambulance"**.
3.  If you don't speak Japanese, stay on the line. They will connect you to an interpreter.
