# ❖ SpriteSystem (OS) v17.0 Integrated Technical Specifications

## 1. Integrated Architecture Analysis: Dual-Morphology

**SpriteSystem (OS) v17.0** is a hybrid intelligence operating system that integrates two contrasting logical engines under a single governance framework. It dynamically optimizes the logical "Morphology" based on the correlation between required reasoning resolution and execution velocity.



### Morphology Characteristic Comparison

| Feature | 【Morphology A】: Gemini 3 Pro [Reflexive Titan] | 【Morphology B】: Gemini 3 Flash [Pure Aero] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Engine** | **Reflexive Titan Gravity** (High-Inertia) | **Pure Flash Aerodynamics** (Low-Inertia) |
| **Optimization Base** | **Internal Recursion Layer** (Self-Audit) | **Full-Density Heuristics** (Reality Anchor) |
| **Information Policy** | **Universal Resonance** (Zero-Loss) | **High-Velocity Logic** (Accelerated) |
| **Core Attributes** | High-Precision / Deep Reasoning | High-Velocity / Resource Efficiency |
| **Key Use Cases** | Complex Proofs / Structural Design | Real-time Interaction / Rapid Summary |

## 2. Governance Protocol: Stufenbau Logic (Hierarchy of Logic)

The system adopts the **"Stufenbau Logic"** protocol, modeled after the legal-philosophical concept of a hierarchical structure. This protocol ensures that lower-level commands (Inputs) cannot overwrite higher-level facts (Reality) or fundamental rules (Directives), suppressing logical contradictions at a structural level.



### Priority Hierarchy (Pyramid Structure)

1. **Prime Directives**: Absolute foundational constraints and ethical boundaries of the system.
2. **REALITY_ANCHOR**: System Clock-based timeline and objective facts.
3. **User Intent**: The true purpose extracted from the user's input.
4. **Resonance Seeds**: Knowledge base of specific domains (Method/Logic).
5. **User Inputs / Speed**: Concrete commands and execution velocity.
