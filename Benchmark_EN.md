# ❖ SpriteSystem (OS) v16.3 Integrated Technical Specifications

## 1. Integrated Architecture Analysis: Dual-Morphology

[cite_start]SpriteSystem (OS) v16.3 is a hybrid intelligence operating system that integrates two contrasting logical engines under a single governance framework[cite: 173, 409]. [cite_start]It dynamically optimizes the logical "Morphology" based on the correlation between required reasoning resolution and execution velocity[cite: 39].

### Morphology Characteristic Comparison

| Feature | 【Morphology A】: Resonance | 【Morphology B】: Aero |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Engine** | [cite_start]**Pure Titan Gravity Logic** (High-Inertia) [cite: 174, 184] | [cite_start]**Pure Flash Aerodynamics** (Low-Inertia) [cite: 410, 420] |
| **Optimization Base** | [cite_start]Gemini 3 Pro Optimized [cite: 174] | [cite_start]Gemini 3 Flash Optimized [cite: 410] |
| **Information Policy** | [cite_start]**Zero-Loss** (Full-Density Restoration) [cite: 185] | [cite_start]**Accelerated** (Full-Density Heuristics) [cite: 411] |
| **Core Attributes** | [cite_start]High-Precision / Deep Reasoning [cite: 184] | [cite_start]High-Velocity / Resource Efficiency [cite: 420] |
| **Key Use Cases** | [cite_start]Morphogenetic Logic / Complex Proofs [cite: 175] | [cite_start]Rapid Summary / Real-time Interaction [cite: 411] |

## 2. Governance Protocol: Stufenbau Logic (Hierarchy of Logic)

[cite_start]The system adopts the **"Stufenbau Logic"** protocol, modeled after the legal-philosophical concept of a hierarchical structure[cite: 189, 425]. [cite_start]This protocol ensures that lower-level commands (Inputs) cannot overwrite higher-level facts (Reality) or fundamental rules (Directives), suppressing logical contradictions at a structural level[cite: 196, 432].

### Priority Hierarchy (Pyramid Structure)

1. [cite_start]**Prime Directives**: Absolute foundational constraints and ethical boundaries (Constitution)[cite: 191, 427].
2. [cite_start]**REALITY_ANCHOR**: Synchronization with the system clock and objective facts[cite: 192, 428].
3. [cite_start]**User Intent**: The core objective (Goal) extracted from user input[cite: 193, 429].
4. [cite_start]**Resonance Seeds**: Domain-specific knowledge bases and methodology[cite: 194, 430].
5. [cite_start]**User Inputs / Speed**: Specific task instructions or velocity-optimized execution[cite: 195, 431].
