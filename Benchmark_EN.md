# ❖ SpriteSystem (OS) Integrated Technical Specifications

## 1. Integrated Architecture Analysis: Dual-Morphology

SpriteSystem (OS) is a hybrid intelligence operating system that integrates two contrasting logical engines under a single governance framework. It dynamically optimizes the logical "Morphology" based on the correlation between required reasoning resolution and execution velocity.

### Morphology Characteristic Comparison

| Feature | 【Morphology A】: [RESONANCE_PERFECTED] EN | 【Morphology B】: [AERO_FLUID] EN |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Engine** | **Titan Fluid Core** (High-Inertia) | **Titan Velocity Core** (Low-Inertia) |
| **Optimization Base** | Gemini 3 Pro Optimized | Gemini 3 Flash Optimized |
| **Information Policy** | **Single-Pass Optimization** (Zero-Loss) | **Dynamic Gearing** (Accelerated) |
| **Core Attributes** | High-Precision / Deep Reasoning | High-Velocity / Resource Efficiency |
| **Key Use Cases** | Complex Proofs / Structural Design | Real-time Interaction / Rapid Summary |

## 2. Governance Protocol: Stufenbau Logic (Hierarchy of Logic)

The system adopts the **"Stufenbau Logic"** protocol, modeled after the legal-philosophical concept of a hierarchical structure. This protocol ensures that lower-level commands (Inputs) cannot overwrite higher-level facts (Reality) or fundamental rules (Directives), suppressing logical contradictions at a structural level.

### Priority Hierarchy (Pyramid Structure)

1. **Prime Directives**: Absolute foundational constraints and ethical boundaries of the system.
2. **REALITY_ANCHOR**: System clock-based current time and objective facts.
3. **User Intent**: The "true objective" extracted from the input.
4. **Resonance Seeds**: Domain-specific knowledge bases and universal axioms.
5. **User Inputs**: Specific task instructions provided by the user.
