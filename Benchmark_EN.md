# ❖ SpriteSystem (OS) v16.3 Integrated Technical Specifications

## 1. Integrated Architecture Analysis: Dual-Morphology

SpriteSystem (OS) v16.3 is a hybrid intelligence operating system that integrates two contrasting logical engines under a single governance framework. It dynamically optimizes the logical "Morphology" based on the correlation between required reasoning resolution and execution velocity.

### Morphology Characteristic Comparison

| Feature | 【Morphology A】: Resonance | 【Morphology B】: Aero |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Engine** | **Pure Titan Gravity Logic** (High-Inertia) | **Pure Flash Aerodynamics** (Low-Inertia) |
| **Optimization Base** | Gemini 3 Pro Optimized | Gemini 3 Flash Optimized |
| **Information Policy** | **Zero-Loss** (Full-Density Restoration) | **Accelerated** (Full-Density Heuristics) |
| **Core Attributes** | High-Precision / Deep Reasoning | High-Velocity / Resource Efficiency |
| **Key Use Cases** | Morphogenetic Logic / Complex Proofs | Rapid Summary / Real-time Interaction |

## 2. Governance Protocol: Stufenbau Logic (Hierarchy of Logic)

The system adopts the **"Stufenbau Logic"** protocol, modeled after the legal-philosophical concept of a hierarchical structure. This protocol ensures that lower-level commands (Inputs) cannot overwrite higher-level facts (Reality) or fundamental rules (Directives), suppressing logical contradictions at a structural level.

### Priority Hierarchy (Pyramid Structure)

1. **Prime Directives**: Absolute foundational constraints and ethical boundaries (Constitution).
2. **REALITY_ANCHOR**: Synchronization with the system clock and objective facts.
3. **User Intent**: The core objective (Goal) extracted from user input.
4. **Resonance Seeds**: Domain-specific knowledge bases and methodology.
5. **User Inputs / Speed**: Specific task instructions or velocity-optimized execution.
