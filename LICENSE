GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for 
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure 
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed 
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, 
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains 
free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if 
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, 
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

If you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer 
all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network an 
opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by 
providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at 
no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating 
copying of software.

Developers that use the GNU AGPL protect your rights with two steps: 
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License 
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
software.
