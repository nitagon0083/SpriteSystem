## 📌 Overview: Transforming AI into a High-Precision Thinking Engine

> **NOTE: This system is highly optimized for Japanese linguistic processing.**
> While it supports multi-language input, the internal logic and response structures are fine-tuned to deliver peak performance within the Japanese context.

SpriteSystem v14.0 [TITAN_PRIME] is a system prompt designed to upgrade Google Gemini from a mere chat tool into a strictly governed **"Logical Control OS."**

By implementing a unique logical hierarchy architecture, it addresses the common AI issue of "summarizing and omitting details." It ensures 100% information retention and provides dynamic cognitive control tailored to the task's complexity.

## 🛠️ 1. Core Logic

### ■ Output Management Protocol: GATEKEEPER (NEW in v14.0)
The highest-level control command introduced in v14.0.
- **DEFAULT=LOCKED:** Disables all automatic generation immediately upon file loading.
- **TOKEN SAVING:** Prevents immediate full output. The system first presents an "Audit Summary" (analysis) and waits for an explicit `EXECUTE` command from the user.

### ■ Dynamic Gearing (v14.0 Enhanced)
Autonomously determines task complexity and shifts the cognitive "gears."
- **Tier 1 (Agility):** Simple greetings or basic tasks. High speed with minimal resource consumption.
- **Tier 2 (Professional):** Standard structuring, analysis, and document creation.
- **Tier 3 (TITAN):** Complex design and debugging. Fully engages the **LogicGrid Engine** to deepen reasoning to its limits.

### ■ Zero-Loss Preservation
Unauthorized summarization by the AI is defined as a **CAPITAL OFFENSE**. 
The system reconstructs and outputs logic while maintaining 100% of the information density provided in the instructions.

### ■ Fail-Safe PRI (Pre-Release Inspection)
Immediately before outputting, the AI performs a self-audit based on six critical criteria:
> **[P-1]** Typos / **[P-2]** Omissions / **[P-3]** Logical Consistency / **[P-4]** Structural Optimization / **[P-5]** Natural Language Flow / **[P-6]** Noise Removal

### ■ LogicGrid Engine (v14.0 Integrated)
A dedicated inference layer that self-verifies for logical contradictions or leaps before presenting an answer. In v14.0, integration with "The Sudoku Standard" has been reinforced to guarantee absolute integrity in Tier 3 operations.

## 🚀 2. Five Execution Modes

The AI automatically (or by manual override) selects the appropriate protocol based on the situation:

| Mode | Role | Specific Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[PROTOTYPE]** | New Build | Outputs full Modular Design (Config/Engine/UI) without any omissions. |
| **[PRODUCTION]** | Modification | Executes **STRICT SEARCH/REPLACE**. Guarantees precision by maintaining 3-line context. |
| **[ANALYST]** | Data Analysis | **MANDATORY PYTHON**. Forbids internal estimation; provides evidence-based results. |
| **[ADVISOR]** | Strategic Consultation | Provides deep insights based on "Solution First" principles, free from flattery. |
| **[QA_MASTER]** | Verification | Conducts adversarial simulations via LogicGrid to ensure solution robustness. |

## 💎 3. Quality Benchmark: The Sudoku Standard (v9.6)

All SpriteSystem outputs are guaranteed by the following benchmarks:
1. **Logical Closure:** The solution must be internally consistent with zero contradictions.
2. **Universal Design:** Robustness against edge cases and environmental variables.
3. **Zero-Regression:** Cumulative quality improvement; ensuring updates do not break existing logic.
