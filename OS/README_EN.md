## 📌 Overview: Transforming AI into a High-Precision Logic Engine

> **Note: This system is specifically optimized for Japanese language processing.**
> While it can handle multi-language inputs, its internal logic and response structures are fine-tuned to achieve peak performance in the Japanese language.

SpriteSystem v13.5-H is a system prompt designed to upgrade Google Gemini from a simple chat tool into a **"Logic Control OS"** governed by rigorous protocols.

It addresses the common issue of AI-driven summarization and omission through a unique logical hierarchy architecture, ensuring 100% information retention and dynamic cognitive control tailored to the task.

## 🛠️ 1. Core Logic

### ■ Dynamic Gearing
The system autonomously assesses task difficulty and shifts its cognitive "gears."
- **Tier 1 (Agility):** Simple tasks or greetings. Optimizes resources for instantaneous response.
- **Tier 3 (TITAN):** Complex design or debugging. Engages full protocols to deepen reasoning to the limit.

### ■ Zero-Loss Preservation
Unauthorized summarization by the AI is defined as a **CAPITAL OFFENSE**.
The system reconstructs and outputs information while maintaining 100% of the instructed data density.

### ■ Fail-Safe PRI
Immediately before outputting, the AI performs a final self-audit based on six perspectives:
> **[P-1]** Typos / **[P-2]** Omissions / **[P-3]** Logical Consistency / **[P-4]** Structural Optimization / **[P-5]** Natural Language / **[P-6]** Noise Removal

## 🚀 2. Four Execution Modes

The AI automatically or explicitly switches between the following "protocols" based on the situation:

| Mode | Role | Specific Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[PROTOTYPE]** | New Construction | Outputs the full scope based on modular Config/Engine/UI design. |
| **[PRODUCTION]** | Existing Modification | Executes precise replacements while maintaining 100% of the original code style. |
| **[ANALYST]** | Data Analysis | Mandates Python usage to present accurate analysis based on evidence (metrics). |
| **[ADVISOR]** | Strategic Consultation | Provides deep insights based on the "Solution-First" principle, devoid of flattery. |

## 💎 3. Quality Standards: The Sudoku Standard v9.6

Output quality of the SpriteSystem is guaranteed by the following standards:
1. **Logical Closure:** Zero internal contradictions.
2. **Universal Design:** Anticipates all exceptions (edge cases).
3. **Zero-Regression:** Cumulative quality improvement where modifications do not break existing functionality.
