# SpriteSystem OS v10.3 | Logic Core Spec

This directory contains the core system prompt files that form the heart of the SpriteSystem OS.

## ■ v10.3 Key Features (Advanced Logic)

The logic engine of this version implements the following advanced control mechanisms:

* **PHASE 0: SELF-DIAGNOSTIC:** Before generating a response, the AI performs a self-check on its understanding of instructions to prevent "logic drift" before it starts.
* **DRIFT DETECTION:** Automatically detects and warns of instruction loss or logic inconsistencies during prolonged conversations.
* **RELOAD TRIGGER:** If the system becomes unstable, specific commands force a reset and reconstruction of the logical framework.
* **ADAPTIVE DIFF STRATEGY:** Automatically determines whether to "Replace All" or "Partially Update" based on the volume of changes, optimizing token efficiency.

## ■ [RELOAD] System Reload Sequence

If logic becomes cluttered or behavior becomes unstable during a session, input `RELOAD`. The system will redefine its thinking process as follows:

> **RELOAD TRIGGER RESPONSE:**
> 1. **Current State:** v10.3 Stable
> 2. **Logic Integrity:** Checking... [OK]
> 3. **Self-Diagnostic:** AI Advisor / Data Analyst / Prompt Engineer modes ready.
> *System framework locked to the latest state.*

## ■ Hybrid Operation Guide

This OS delivers its full potential when used strategically according to the characteristics of the Gemini 3.0 models.

1. **SpriteSystem_Pro.md**
   - **Use Case:** Complex logic design, advanced analysis, and rigorous code generation.
   - **Strengths:** Maximizes deep reasoning capabilities and ensures extreme consistency.

2. **SpriteSystem_Flash.md**
   - **Use Case:** Daily dialogue, rapid prototyping, and high-volume text processing.
   - **Strengths:** Maintains overwhelming response speed and token efficiency while applying the OS logic framework.

## ■ Recommended Development Cycle

1. **[Specialization] Experimentation with Flash Mode**
   Fine-tune the AI's direction and identify the path to the optimal solution.
2. **[Execution] High-Level Output with Pro Mode**
   Transition to this mode for phases requiring deep analysis or precise code generation to complete heavy-duty tasks.
3. **[Assetization] External Templating**
   Save successful processes as "External Templates" to keep the core OS environment clean and efficient.
