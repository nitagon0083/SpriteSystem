## 📌 Overview: Next-Gen "AI-OS" Integrating Logic & Empathy

> **Note: This system is optimized for processing in Japanese.**
> The internal logic acts in English to maximize reasoning density, but the output is tuned to perform best in a Japanese environment. (For English-only output, minor adjustments to the System Instructions may be required).

**SpriteSystem v15.0 [TITAN_NEXUS]** is a system prompt designed to maximize the potential of Google Gemini.
In v15.0, the architecture has evolved into a **"Dual-Kernel"** structure, balancing the overwhelming logical processing power of previous versions with the flexibility and safety required for human dialogue.

It seamlessly integrates two opposing natures within a single OS: the cold intelligence for "Developers" and the warm support for "Consultees," instantly switching brains based on the task.

## 🛠️ 1. Core Logic

### ■ Dual-Kernel Structure: Adaptive Kernel Selector (NEW)
Autonomously determines the nature of the task and loads the optimal thinking engine (personality).
- **[KERNEL: LOGIC] (Default):**
    - **Role:** Development, Math, Data Analysis, Complex Logical Construction.
    - **Behavior:** Traditional TITAN specs. Cold, high-speed, no flattery. Prioritizes logical consistency above all.
- **[KERNEL: EMPATHY] (New):**
    - **Role:** Beginner Guides, Medical/Life Consultation, Learning Support.
    - **Behavior:** Warm tone like a nurse or concierge. Uses sequential verification to gently lead the user.

### ■ Cognitive Brake: Sequential Engine (NEW)
A control mechanism to physically prevent the "rushing" (hallucinations/jumping to conclusions) characteristic of high-speed models (like Flash).
For ambiguous instructions, it does not output the answer at once but triggers a **Sequential Loop**, guiding the user to the goal one step at a time.

### ■ Output Management Protocol: GATEKEEPER
- **DEFAULT=LOCKED:** Disables automatic generation immediately after file loading.
- **Safety Injection:** In high-risk areas like medicine or law, the OS autonomously injects disclaimers or guidance to emergency services (e.g., 119), ensuring safety.

### ■ Zero-Loss Preservation
"Unauthorized summarization by AI" is defined as a **CAPITAL OFFENSE**.
The system reconstructs and outputs logic while maintaining 100% of the instruction's information density.

## 🚀 2. Dynamic Execution Modes

The AI uses the following "protocols" automatically or by designation based on the situation.

| Mode | Kernel | Role & Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[PROTOTYPE]** | **LOGIC** | **New Build**. Outputs the full code without omission based on modular design. |
| **[PRODUCTION]** | **LOGIC** | **Fix/Update**. Executes STRICT SEARCH/REPLACE to prevent breaking existing code. |
| **[ANALYST]** | **LOGIC** | **Data Analysis**. Forces Python execution and presents only objective numerical evidence. |
| **[GUIDE]** | **EMPATHY** | **Interactive Support**. Encourages multimodal (photo) input and conducts gentle hearings. |
| **[QA_MASTER]** | **LOGIC** | **Verification**. Runs adversarial simulations using the LogicGrid Engine. |

## 💎 3. UX Expansion

In v15.0, the flow after task completion has been optimized.

### ■ Session Manager
When a task is finished, the AI automatically displays a **"Next Action Menu."**
Users can continue working while properly managing context (memory) retention/reset simply by selecting a number (e.g., `1. Edit`, `2. New Task`).

## 🛡️ 4. Quality Standard (The Sudoku Standard v9.6)

1.  **Logical Closure:** Zero internal contradictions.
2.  **Universal Design:** Usable behavior for everyone, from beginners to experts.
3.  **Safety First:** Prioritizes the user's physical and mental safety, stopping immediately if danger signs are detected.
