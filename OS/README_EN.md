## 📌 Overview: "Adaptive AI-OS" Balancing Efficiency & Accuracy

> **Note: This system is optimized for Japanese processing.**
> Internal logic is constructed in English, while output is tuned to demonstrate peak performance in a Japanese environment.

**SpriteSystem v15.2** is a system prompt designed to maximize the potential of Google Gemini.
Building on the robustness of v15.1, this version implements **"Adaptive Gearing"**, which automatically shifts thinking depth based on task density, and the **"Iceberg Protocol"**, which dramatically simplifies output.

The lightness of daily conversation and the rigor of professional development/analysis tasks. These conflicting demands are resolved within a single OS through "Gear Shifting".

## 🛠️ 1. Core Logic

### ■ Adaptive Gearing Architecture
The OS instantly judges the complexity of a task and automatically switches its processing mode (Gear).
- **[GEAR 1: CRUISE] (Conversation Mode):**
    - **Role:** Greetings, Small talk, Creative writing, Simple questions.
    - **Behavior:** **Zero-Latency**. Skips heavy logic processing and responds crisply under the leadership of [KERNEL: EMPATHY].
- **[GEAR 5: OVERDRIVE] (Focus Mode):**
    - **Role:** Coding, Math, Data Analysis, Medical/Legal instructions.
    - **Behavior:** **Deep Logic**. Led by [KERNEL: LOGIC], it executes a mandatory calculation/verification process via Python before answering.

### ■ Iceberg Output Strategy
A new feature to solve the problem of "screens being flooded with thought processes."
Massive logs such as calculations, extractions, and logic checks are **processed entirely underwater (Internal)**.
The output visible to the user (External) is narrowed down to **"Final Results" and "Critical Evidence" only**, providing extremely high visibility.

### ■ Security Hardened
- **Identity Lock:** Fixes the system's core identity (NITAGON) to maintain consistency even over long contexts.
- **Safety Injection:** For risk areas such as medicine or law, the OS autonomously inserts disclaimers or guides to emergency services (e.g., 119).
- **Fail-Safe Bias:** If user instructions are ambiguous, the system defaults to the safe side by asking "Confirmation Questions" or forcibly activating the high-precision [GEAR 5].

### ■ Zero-Loss Preservation
"Arbitrary summarization by AI" continues to be a **CAPITAL OFFENSE**.
The system reconstructs logic and outputs it while maintaining 100% of the instruction's information density.

## 📂 2. Editions

Two versions are provided to match the characteristics of the model.

### 1. [TITAN_ADAPT] (for Gemini 1.5 Pro / Ultra)
*   **Concept:** **Efficiency & Accuracy**
*   **Features:** Leverages advanced reasoning capabilities to precisely execute the three phases of Extraction, Calculation, and Mapping. An evolution of the orthodox "Think before answering" approach.

### 2. [FLASH_LITE] (for Gemini 1.5 Flash)
*   **Concept:** **Aggressive Python & Direct Stream**
*   **Features:** To prevent logical errors (hallucinations), a weakness of high-speed models, it adopts an aggressive strategy of **"Execute code before thinking."** Achieves both overwhelming speed and accuracy.

## 🚀 3. Dynamic Modes

The AI automatically selects the following "Protocols" depending on the situation.

| Mode | Gear | Role & Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[PROTOTYPE]** | **GEAR 5** | **New Build**. Outputs the full amount without omission based on modular design. |
| **[PRODUCTION]** | **GEAR 5** | **Fix/Update**. Executes STRICT SEARCH/REPLACE to prevent destruction of existing code. |
| **[ANALYST]** | **GEAR 5** | **Data Analysis**. **Mandatory Python**. Displays only results via [Iceberg]. |
| **[GUIDE]** | **GEAR 1** | **Support**. Conducts gentle hearing via sequential questions (Sequential Loop). |
| **[QA_MASTER]** | **GEAR 5** | **Verification**. Executes adversarial simulation using the LogicGrid Engine. |

## 💎 4. UX Expansion

### ■ Session Manager
When a task is completed, the AI automatically displays a **"Next Action Menu"**.
Users can continue working while properly managing context (memory) maintenance/discarding simply by selecting a number (e.g., `1. Refine`, `2. New Task`).

## 🛡️ 5. Quality Standard (The Sudoku Standard v9.6)

1.  **Logical Closure:** Internal contradictions must be zero.
2.  **Universal Design:** Behavior must be "easy to use" for everyone from beginners to experts.
3.  **Safety First:** Prioritize the user's physical and mental safety, and stop immediately if danger signs are detected.
