# SpriteSystem OS v10.3 [Flash Edition] | Logic Core Spec

This directory contains the core system prompt files for SpriteSystem OS.

## ■ v10.3 Core Features (Advanced Logic)

The logic engine for this version implements the following advanced control mechanisms:

* **PHASE 0: SELF-DIAGNOSTIC:** Before generating a response, the AI performs a self-check on its understanding of instructions to prevent logical drift.
* **DRIFT DETECTION:** Automatically detects and warns of inconsistencies or instruction loss during prolonged conversations.
* **RELOAD TRIGGER:** Forcefully resets and reconstructs the logical framework using specific commands if the system becomes unstable.
* **ADAPTIVE DIFF STRATEGY:** Optimizes token efficiency by automatically choosing between "full replacement" and "partial modification" based on the volume of changes.

## ■ [RELOAD] System Reload Sequence

If logic becomes complex and behavior turns unstable during a conversation, enter the `RELOAD` command. The following process will redefine the thought framework:

> **RELOAD TRIGGER RESPONSE:**
> 1. **Current State:** v10.3 Stable
> 2. **Logic Integrity:** Checking... [OK]
> 3. **Self-Diagnostic:** AI Advisor / Data Analyst / Prompt Engineer modes ready.
> *Logical framework has been locked to the latest state.*

## ■ Case Study: Stress Test and Logical Recovery Validation (Gemini 3.0 Flash)

A field test was conducted on **SpriteSystem v10.3 [Flash Edition]** to verify the system's peak performance and resilience.

### 1. Experiment: High-Density Virtual Simulation
* **Environment**: Gemini 3.0 Flash.
* **Workload**: Full output of large-scale source code (over 300 lines) with a "NO OMISSION" constraint.
* **Result**: Success. The virtual simulation maintained consistency until the end, outputting the full content without any omissions, proving the validity of the design theory.

### 2. Incident: Logical Drift and Command Rejection
* **Event**: Immediately following the high-load output, a severe **Logical Drift** occurred.
* **Situation**: Due to historical noise, the system entered a state of malfunction where even text commands like `RELOAD` were not recognized or executed.

### 3. Recovery: Forced Recovery via Physical Reload
* **Action**: Since text commands were ineffective, a physical resynchronization was performed by re-uploading the OS definition file.
* **Result**: Successfully returned to the **READY** state within the same session by purging the interference caused by historical noise.
* **Validation**: Immediately after recovery, the system performed a meta-analysis of its own malfunctioning logs and proved that its cognitive capacity was fully restored by reconstructing this report.

### 4. Operational Insights
* **Physical Recovery**: Even during a severe collapse where text commands fail, cognitive restoration is possible by re-injecting the definition file.
* **Recommended Flow**: After any large-scale output, performing a definition reload ensures stable intelligence and allows work to continue without switching sessions.

## ■ Recommended Development Cycle: Professional Loop

A recommended workflow to optimize for accuracy, speed, and cost.

1. **[Design] Prompt Creation in Flash Mode**
    Utilize fast response times to refine a "Job Specification (Template)" through dialogue.
2. **[Build] Full Prototype Output in Pro Mode**
    Feed the refined spec into Pro. Use deep reasoning to generate the first complete version (code or long documents) in a perfect state.
3. **[Refine] Partial Output in Pro Mode (Token Saving)**
    For subsequent edits, maintain Pro's logic and context while outputting only the "Diffs (modified parts)" to ensure accuracy while reducing token consumption.
4. **[Polish] Final Output in Pro Mode**
    Perform final fine-tuning and integration back in Pro. Verify logic and consistency to generate a high-quality final product.
5. **[Assetize] Template Preservation**
    Save successful processes as "External Templates" to keep the core OS state clean.
