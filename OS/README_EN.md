## 📌 Overview: Transforming AI into a "High-Precision Reasoning Engine"

> **Note: This system is optimized for processing in Japanese.**
> While multilingual input is supported, the internal logic and response structures are tuned for peak performance within a Japanese language environment.

SpriteSystem v13.6 [TITAN_REFORGED] is a system prompt designed to upgrade Google Gemini from a simple chat tool into a **"Logic Control OS"** based on strict protocols.

It solves the common issue of "AI-driven summarization or omission" through a unique logical hierarchy architecture. It ensures 100% information integrity and provides dynamic cognitive control tailored to the task at hand.

## 🛠️ 1. Core Logic

### ■ Dynamic Gearing (v13.6 Enhanced)
The AI autonomously assesses task difficulty and switches its cognitive "gears."
- **Tier 1 (Agility):** Greetings and simple tasks. Minimizes resource usage for instantaneous responses.
- **Tier 2 (Professional):** Standard structuring, analysis, and document creation.
- **Tier 3 (TITAN):** Complex design and debugging. Fully engages the **LogicGrid Engine** to deepen reasoning to its limits.

### ■ Zero-Loss Preservation
"Unauthorized summarization by the AI" is defined as a **CAPITAL OFFENSE**.
The system re-architects logic and generates output while maintaining 100% of the information density as instructed.

### ■ Fail-Safe PRI
Immediately before output, the AI performs a final audit of its own response based on six perspectives:
> **[P-1]** Typos / **[P-2]** Omissions / **[P-3]** Logical Consistency / **[P-4]** Structural Optimization / **[P-5]** Natural Language Flow / **[P-6]** Noise Reduction

### ■ LogicGrid Engine (NEW in v13.6)
Implements a dedicated reasoning layer that performs multi-faceted self-verification for logical contradictions or leaps before presenting an answer. Guarantees "Absolute Consistency" in Tier 3 operations.

## 🚀 2. Four Execution Modes

The AI automatically selects or switches between these "Protocols" based on the situation or specific instructions:

| Mode | Role | Specific Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[PROTOTYPE]** | New Construction | Generates full-scale output based on modular designs of Config/Engine/UI. |
| **[PRODUCTION]** | Existing Modification | Executes precise replacements while maintaining 100% of the existing code style. |
| **[ANALYST]** | Data Analysis | Forces the use of Python to present accurate analysis results based on evidence (data). |
| **[ADVISOR]** | Strategic Consultation | Provides deep insights based on the "Solution First" principle, eschewing flattery. |

## 💎 3. Quality Standard: The Sudoku Standard v9.6

SpriteSystem's output quality is guaranteed by the following standards:
1. **Logical Closure:** Zero internal contradictions.
2. **Universal Design:** Accounts for all potential edge cases.
3. **Zero-Regression:** Cumulative quality improvement where fixes do not break existing functionality.
