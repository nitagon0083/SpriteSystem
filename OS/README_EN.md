## 📌 Overview: Transforming AI into a High-Precision Logic Engine

SpriteSystem v13.4 is a system prompt designed to upgrade Google Gemini from a simple chatbot into a **"Logic Control OS"** governed by strict protocols.

It solves the common AI issue of unauthorized summarization and data loss through a unique hierarchical architecture, ensuring 100% information retention and autonomous cognitive scaling.

## ⚠️ Important: Language Protocol Notice

**This OS is specifically optimized for Japanese Output.**

- **Internal Logic:** The system utilizes English for internal reasoning to maximize logic density and processing speed.
- **External Output:** The results are re-composed into **Natural Japanese** by default.
- *Note: Global users may need to adjust the `[GATEKEEPER]` or `Output Circuit` settings within the prompt if output in other languages is required.*

## 🛠️ 1. Core Logic Features

### ■ Dynamic Gearing
Autonomously assesses task complexity and shifts the "cognitive gear" accordingly.
- **Tier 1 (Agility):** For simple tasks or greetings. Minimizes latency for instant response.
- **Tier 3 (TITAN):** For complex architecture, debugging, or deep analysis. Activates the full logic suite, including **VEE (Virtual Execution Environment)** and **Explicit CoT**.

### ■ Zero-Loss Preservation
Unauthorized summarization or omission is defined as a **CAPITAL OFFENSE**. The system is programmed to reconstruct 100% of the provided information detail.

### ■ Fail-Safe PRI (Inspection)
Mandatory 6-point silent check before any output is delivered:
> **[P-1]** Typos & Syntax / **[P-2]** Integrity (No Loss) / **[P-3]** Consistency / **[P-4]** Optimization / **[P-5]** Linguistic Nuance / **[P-6]** Metadata Cleanup

## 🚀 2. Operational Modes

The AI autonomously (or by instruction) selects the appropriate protocol for the task:

| Mode | Role | Specific Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[PROTOTYPE]** | Initial Creation | Generates full-scale output based on Config/Engine/UI modular design. |
| **[PRODUCTION]** | Modification | Applies "Strict Search/Replace" to maintain existing code style and context. |
| **[ANALYST]** | Data Analysis | Mandatory Python execution to ensure results based on empirical evidence. |
| **[ADVISOR]** | Strategy | Delivers deep, logic-first insights while strictly excluding flattery or filler. |

## 💎 3. Quality Standard: The Sudoku Standard (v9.6)

All outputs are verified against the following benchmarks:
1. **Logical Closure:** Absolute consistency with zero internal contradictions.
2. **Universal Design:** Robustness against all edge cases and exceptions.
3. **Zero-Regression:** Cumulative quality improvement without breaking existing features.
