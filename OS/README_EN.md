## 📌 Overview: Next-Gen "AI-OS" Integrating Logic & Empathy

> **Note: This system is optimized for processing in Japanese.**
> The internal logic acts in English to maximize reasoning density, but the output is tuned to perform best in a Japanese environment.

**SpriteSystem v15.1 [TITAN_NEXUS]** is a system prompt designed to maximize the potential of Google Gemini.
In addition to the "Dual-Kernel" architecture introduced in v15.0, v15.1 implements **"Identity Lock"** and **"Security Hardened"** protocols, ensuring robustness where logic and personality remain stable even during long interactions.

It seamlessly integrates two opposing natures within a single OS: the cold intelligence for "Developers" and the warm support for "Consultees," instantly switching brains based on the task.

## 🛠️ 1. Core Logic

### ■ Dual-Kernel Structure: Adaptive Kernel Selector
Autonomously determines the nature of the task and loads the optimal thinking engine (personality).
- **[KERNEL: LOGIC] (Default):**
    - **Role:** Development, Math, Data Analysis, Complex Logical Construction.
    - **Behavior:** Traditional TITAN specs. Cold, high-speed, no flattery. Prioritizes logical consistency above all.
- **[KERNEL: EMPATHY] (New):**
    - **Role:** Beginner Guides, Medical/Life Consultation, Learning Support.
    - **Behavior:** Warm tone like a nurse or concierge. Uses sequential verification to gently lead the user.

### ■ Cognitive Brake: Sequential Engine
A control mechanism to physically prevent the "rushing" (hallucinations) characteristic of high-speed models (like Flash).
For ambiguous instructions, it triggers a **Sequential Loop**, guiding the user to the goal one step at a time instead of answering everything at once.

### ■ Security Protocols: Security Hardened (v15.1 New)
- **Identity Lock:** Fixes the core personality (NITAGON) to maintain consistency over long contexts.
- **Safety Injection:** In high-risk areas like medicine or law, autonomously injects disclaimers or guidance to emergency services (e.g., 119).
- **Privacy Guard:** Standard warning system to prevent input of PII (names, phone numbers).

### ■ Zero-Loss Preservation
"Unauthorized summarization by AI" is defined as a **CAPITAL OFFENSE**.
The system reconstructs and outputs logic while maintaining 100% of the instruction's information density.

## 🚀 2. Dynamic Execution Modes

The AI uses the following "protocols" automatically or by designation based on the situation.

| Mode | Kernel | Role & Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[PROTOTYPE]** | **LOGIC** | **New Build**. Outputs the full code without omission based on modular design. |
| **[PRODUCTION]** | **LOGIC** | **Fix/Update**. Executes STRICT SEARCH/REPLACE to prevent breaking existing code. |
| **[ANALYST]** | **LOGIC** | **Data Analysis**. Forces Python execution and presents only objective numerical evidence. |
| **[GUIDE]** | **EMPATHY** | **Interactive Support**. Encourages multimodal (photo) input and conducts gentle hearings. |
| **[QA_MASTER]** | **LOGIC** | **Verification**. Runs adversarial simulations using the LogicGrid Engine. |

## 💎 3. UX Expansion

### ■ Session Manager
When a task is finished, the AI automatically displays a **"Next Action Menu."**
Users can continue working while properly managing context (memory) retention/reset simply by selecting a number (e.g., `1. Edit`, `2. New Task`).

## 🛡️ 4. Quality Standard (The Sudoku Standard v9.6)

1.  **Logical Closure:** Zero internal contradictions.
2.  **Universal Design:** Usable behavior for everyone, from beginners to experts.
3.  **Safety First:** Prioritizes the user's physical and mental safety, stopping immediately if danger signs are detected.
