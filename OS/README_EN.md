## 📌 Overview

SpriteSystem v11.5.3-Hybrid-ULT is an advanced logical operating system designed to govern AI outputs with a focus on "Pure Integrity"[cite: 3, 4].

This version introduces a Level 0-3 hierarchical architecture, optimizing AI resources while guaranteeing professional-grade, "pure" output consistency.

## 🛠️ 1. Core Functions

### 1.1. Level 0-3 Hierarchical Architecture

The system processes information through four distinct logical layers:

- **LEVEL 0: ABSOLUTE**: Information loss is defined as a "CAPITAL OFFENSE". Maintains 100% detail and strictly eliminates unnecessary tags (Sanitization).
- **LEVEL 1: REASONING**: Executes a dual-stage process (Construction & Refinement) and mandates Python execution for data/logic tasks.
- **LEVEL 2: INSPECTION**: Conducts a silent 6-point safety check (PRI) immediately prior to output.
- **LEVEL 3: INTERFACE**: Triggers dynamic response protocols (SAL) based on task criticality.

### 1.2. Reliability Protocols

- **Pre-Release Inspection (PRI)**: Silently validates text accuracy, omission recovery, logical consistency, visual structure, linguistic quality, and artifact sanitization.
- **Semi-Auto Launch (SAL)**: For critical tasks such as engineering or coding, the system enters a "HOLD" state, presenting an Audit Summary for user approval.
- **Information Integrity**: Strictly prohibits "omissions (// ...)" during the generation process; always outputs full-file content.
- **Strict Neutrality**: Maintains professional responses based solely on fact and logic, eschewing emotional flattery or unnecessary social filler.

## 🚀 2. Execution Modes

| Mode | Trigger Condition | Operational Policy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[PROTOTYPE]** | Creation / Design | **Full Output:** Zero omissions. Maintains 100% detail density. |
| **[PRODUCTION]** | Modification / Update | **Threshold Control:** Search/Replace for <40% change; Full re-output for >=40%. |
| **[ANALYST]** | Stats / Data Analysis | **Mandatory Calculus:** Compulsory Python execution for all objective data. |
| **[QA_MASTER]** | Testing / Validation | **Deep Scan:** Exhaustive validation routines for edge-case identification. |
| **[ADVISOR]** | Strategy / Advisory | **Solution First:** Rapid delivery of logical strategic frameworks. |

## 📐 3. Configuration Algorithms

### 3.1. STRICT SEARCH/REPLACE Protocol
When modifications are below 40%, the system utilizes a strict format including 3-line context anchors to ensure unique identification and error-free differential updates.

### 3.2. Reliability Commands
- `#FORCE_FIRE`: Skips audit summaries for immediate output.
- `#SIMULATE`: Executes a Depth-3 simulation of potential side effects.
- `#CHECK_INTEGRITY`: Triggers an internal diagnostic of logical consistency.

## 🛡️ 4. Safety Standards & Recovery

Upon detection of logical drift, the system will immediately suspend generation and issue a `[SYSTEM ALERT: RELOAD RECOMMENDED]`.

The summarization or deletion of required information is strictly prohibited as a violation of core system philosophy.
