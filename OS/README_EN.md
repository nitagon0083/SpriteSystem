# SpriteSystem OS v10.3 | Logic Core Spec

This directory contains the system prompt files that form the core of SpriteSystem OS.

## ■ v10.3 Core Features (Advanced Logic)

This version of the logic engine implements the following advanced control mechanisms:

* **PHASE 0: SELF-DIAGNOSTIC:** Before responding, the AI self-checks its understanding of instructions to prevent "logic drift" before it starts.
* **DRIFT DETECTION:** Automatically detects and alerts for instruction forgetfulness or logical deviations during prolonged conversations.
* **RELOAD TRIGGER:** Forces a reset and restructuring of the logical framework via specific commands if the system becomes unstable.
* **ADAPTIVE DIFF STRATEGY:** Automatically switches between "Full Rewrite" and "Partial Edit" based on the volume of changes to optimize token efficiency.

## ■ [RELOAD] System Reload Sequence

If the logic becomes overly complex or behavior becomes unstable, enter `RELOAD`. The following process will redefine the thought framework:

> **RELOAD TRIGGER RESPONSE:**
> 1. **Current State:** v10.3 Stable
> 2. **Logic Integrity:** Checking... [OK]
> 3. **Self-Diagnostic:** AI Advisor / Data Analyst / Prompt Engineer modes ready.
> *The framework of thought has been locked to the latest state.*

## ■ Hybrid Workflow Guide

This OS maximizes its potential by strategically utilizing the characteristics of each Gemini 3.0 model.

1. **SpriteSystem_Pro.md**
    - **Usage:** Complex logic design, advanced analysis, and strict code generation.
    - **Strength:** Maximizes deep reasoning capabilities to provide ultimate consistency.
2. **SpriteSystem_Flash.md**
    - **Usage:** Daily interaction, rapid prototyping, and high-volume text processing.
    - **Strength:** Maintains overwhelming response speed and token efficiency while applying the OS logic framework.

## ■ Recommended Development Cycle: Professional Loop

This flow is designed to optimize "Precision, Speed, and Cost" to the extreme.

1. **[Design] Prompt Engineering with Flash**
    Leverage fast response times to refine task-specific "Templates" through rapid dialogue.
2. **[Build] Full Prototype Output with Pro**
    Feed the refined template into the Pro model. Use its deep reasoning to generate a perfect first-edition prototype (code or long-form documentation).
3. **[Refine] Partial Output with Pro (Token Saving)**
    For subsequent edits, generate only "diffs" (updates) to maintain high logical consistency and context awareness while minimizing token consumption.
4. **[Finalize] Final Output with Pro**
    Perform final adjustments and integration within the Pro model to ensure logical integrity and generate the highest quality deliverables.
5. **[Assetization] Template Preservation**
    Save the successful process as an "External Template" to keep the OS in a clean, high-performance state.
