# SpriteSystem

SpriteSystem is a high-performance system prompt designed to transform Google Gemini into an "AI Operating System."
While an experimental project developed by an individual, its core mission is to unlock the full logical potential of the AI and achieve **Zero-Loss Information Preservation**.

## 🌌 Design Philosophy

> **NOTE: This system is highly optimized for Japanese linguistic processing.**
> While the internal logic is built in English, the output structures are fine-tuned to deliver peak performance in a Japanese-speaking environment.

This system is built upon three core pillars:

### 1. Separation of OS (Core) and Template (Purpose)
> **"Never bloat the OS with specific task-oriented instructions."**
The Base OS is kept clean at all times. By utilizing "External Templates" for specific tasks, we prevent precision degradation caused by prompt bloat and maintain consistent high performance.

### 2. Control via "GATEKEEPER" and "Dynamic Gearing"
The **GATEKEEPER** protocol, introduced in v14.0, suppresses the AI's default high-speed generation. Simultaneously, it features **"Dynamic Gearing,"** which shifts the depth of reasoning based on task complexity, balancing Zero-Loss information integrity with comfortable responsiveness.

### 3. Logical Integrity via LogicGrid Engine
The system mandates step-by-step verification via LogicGrid to eliminate ambiguity. For critical tasks such as debugging or mathematical proofs, the AI automatically executes Python to ensure objective accuracy, adhering to **"The Sudoku Standard."**

## ✅ Proven Use Cases

The developer has personally verified the system's utility in the following domains. Knowledge gained from practical use is continuously fed back into the OS through a "Feedback Loop" to refine its precision.

| Category | Practical Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced Prompt Design** | Building high-density, high-precision instruction sets via LogicGrid. |
| **Data Analysis** | Precision statistics, analysis, and graph generation using Python. |
| **Strategic Discussion** | Providing multi-faceted perspectives as a "Cold External Intelligence" free from flattery. |
| **Document Processing** | High-precision translation and rewriting with 100% information retention. |
| **Software Development** | Generating logic-consistent, bug-free code through Zero-Loss protocols. |

## 📦 Distribution Files

The latest versions can be obtained from the following files within the repository:

* **[SpriteSystem_Pro.md](./OS/SpriteSystem_Pro.md)**
    * **Recommended Use**: High-complexity tasks (Logical reasoning, precision design, development).
    * **Features**: Powered by v14.0 [TITAN_PRIME]. Unparalleled stability via LogicGrid and GATEKEEPER.
* **[SpriteSystem_Flash.md](./OS/SpriteSystem_Flash.md)**
    * **Recommended Use**: Daily tasks (Speed, token efficiency, lightweight use).
    * **Features**: Powered by v14.0-F [FLASH_OVERDRIVE]. Overcomes logical leaps common in Flash models via the Brake System.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Deployment**: Copy the code from `Pro` or `Flash` and set it as your AI's System Instructions.
2.  **Boot**: Once loaded, the AI will respond with **`System Ready. Standing by for instructions.`**, and the output gate will be frozen (Standby state).
3.  **Execution**: 
    * When you submit a request, the AI will first present an **Audit Summary** (analysis report).
    * Review the summary; if everything looks correct, issue the command **`EXECUTE`** or **`OK`** to begin the full process.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Compatibility

### Compatibility
Optimized for the Google Gemini Series (**3 Pro / Flash**).

> **Note**: While the design principles may be applicable to other LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT-4), functionality is not guaranteed due to model-specific behaviors. Use with other models at your **own risk**.

### Disclaimer
* **Non-Commercial / Personal Project**: This is an experimental personal project. The developer makes no warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the information provided.
* **Assumption of Risk**: The developer shall not be liable for any damages (direct or indirect) arising from the use of this system or prompt.
* **No Guarantee of Operation**: Behaviors or protocols may change due to future AI model updates.
