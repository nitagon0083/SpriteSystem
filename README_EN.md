# SpriteSystem

System prompt designed to function as an "AI-based OS" for Google Gemini.

This is an experimental project developed by an individual beginner, with the primary objective of maximizing the latent capabilities of AI.

## 🌌 Core Philosophy

> **Note: This system is specifically optimized for Japanese language processing.**
> While it can handle multi-language inputs, its internal logic and response structures are fine-tuned to achieve peak performance and nuance in the Japanese language.

The system is designed based on the following three fundamental principles:

### 1. Decoupling of OS (Core) and Templates (Purpose)
> **"Avoid embedding specific purposes directly into the OS core."**

This is the most critical rule of the system. Overloading the OS with specific instructions leads to a decline in precision. By maintaining a clean Core (OS) and utilizing "External Templates" for specific tasks, the system ensures peak performance at all times.

### 2. Comfort through "Dynamic Gearing"
A new feature introduced in v13.4. The AI autonomously determines whether the task is a simple greeting or a complex assignment. It responds quickly to simple tasks and dedicates full focus to demanding ones. This "gearing" ensures a seamless, stress-free user experience.

### 3. Flexibility and Ensuring Precision
We value "Flexibility," allowing the AI to think freely without being overly restricted by instructions. However, during critical operations (such as code debugging), the system automatically switches to its most meticulous mode via the **"Fail-Safe Bias,"** ensuring the most reliable response for the given situation.

## ✅ Proven Track Record and Evolution

The developer has verified the system's utility through the following tasks. Precision is continuously refined via a **"Feedback Loop"** that integrates insights gained from practical application back into the OS.

| Category | Specific Applications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced Prompt Design** | Construction of high-density instructions optimized for various LLMs. |
| **Data Analysis** | Deconstruction of complex information and derivation of logical conclusions. |
| **Discussion** | Multi-faceted debates and deep-dives to expand conceptual reach. |
| **Document Writing** | Drafting of reports and articles with logical structures. |
| **App Development** | Architectural design, logic construction, and coding assistance. |

## 📦 Distribution Files

The latest versions are available from the repository files:

* **[SpriteSystem_Pro.md](./OS/SpriteSystem_Pro.md)**
    * **Recommended Use**: High-load tasks (logical thinking, precision design, development, etc.)
    * **Features**: Equipped with v13.5-H [COMPOSED_TITAN]. Operates with agility normally, but unleashes maximum logical power when required.
* **[SpriteSystem_Flash.md](./OS/SpriteSystem_Flash.md)**
    * **Recommended Use**: Daily tasks (high-speed response, token efficiency, ease of use)
    * **Features**: A lightweight edition focused on speed and simplicity.

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Deployment**: Copy the code from `Pro` or `Flash` from the links above and set it in your AI system prompt.
2.  **Execution**: Once the OS is initialized, convey your intent.
3.  **Operation**: **Do not overwrite the OS itself**; create and execute templates through dialogue.

## ■ Support

The development of SpriteSystem is a project of passion, created by the author within limited time while facing cancer treatment.

If this system has been helpful and you feel inclined to support my work, a donation of a single cup of coffee would be greatly appreciated. Your support will be carefully used for treatment costs and maintaining the development environment.
