# SpriteSystem

SpriteSystem is a high-performance "AI Operating System" prompt designed for Google Gemini.
While an experimental project developed by an individual, its core mission is to unlock the full logical potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and achieve **Zero-Loss Information Preservation**.

## 🌌 Design Philosophy

> **NOTE: This system is highly optimized for Japanese processing.**
> While it supports multi-language input, the internal logic and output structure are fine-tuned to deliver peak performance in the Japanese linguistic context.

The architecture is built upon three pillar concepts:

### 1. Separation of OS (Core) and Template (Task)
> **"Never bloat the OS with specific task instructions."**

Loading too many specific instructions into the core OS degrades precision. By keeping the Base OS clean and utilizing "External Templates" for specific tasks, we maintain consistent high performance.

### 2. "GATEKEEPER" Protocol (Strict Output Control)
A flagship feature of v14.0. It suppresses the AI's default "high-speed generation" bias. By forcing a verification process before any output, it eliminates the model's tendency to summarize or omit details, ensuring **Zero-Loss Preservation**.

### 3. LogicGrid Engine (Logical Integrity)
Removes ambiguity through step-by-step verification. For critical tasks such as code debugging or mathematical proofs, the system mandates **MANDATORY PYTHON** execution to verify results against **"The Sudoku Standard"**—ensuring objective accuracy.

## ✅ Proven Use Cases

The developer has verified the system's utility in the following domains. Knowledge gained from these practical applications is continuously fed back into the OS core.

| Category | Practical Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced Prompt Design** | Building high-density instruction sets via LogicGrid |
| **Data Analysis** | Precision statistics and analysis with Python integration |
| **Strategic Discussion** | Providing multi-faceted perspectives as a Cold External Intelligence |
| **Document Processing** | Translation and rewriting with 100% information retention |
| **Software Development** | Bug-free code generation through Zero-Loss protocols |

## 📦 Distribution Files

The latest versions can be obtained from the following files within the repository:

* **[SpriteSystem_Pro.md](./OS/SpriteSystem_Pro.md)**
    * **Recommended Use**: High-complexity tasks (Logic, Design, Development).
    * **Features**: Powered by v14.0 [TITAN_PRIME]. Unparalleled stability via LogicGrid & GATEKEEPER.
* **[SpriteSystem_Flash.md](./OS/SpriteSystem_Flash.md)**
    * **Recommended Use**: Daily tasks (Speed, Token efficiency).
    * **Features**: Powered by v14.0-F [FLASH_OVERDRIVE]. Eliminates "Logical Drift" common in lightweight models.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Deployment**: Copy the code from `Pro` or `Flash` and set it as your AI's System Instructions.
2.  **Boot**: Once loaded, the AI will enter a "STANDBY" state.
3.  **Execution**: Review the initial **Audit Summary**. If verified, issue the `EXECUTE` command to proceed.
