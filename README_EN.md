# SpriteSystem

System prompt designed to function as an "AI-based OS" for Google Gemini.

This is an experimental project developed by an individual beginner, with the primary objective of maximizing the latent capabilities of AI.

---

## 🌌 Core Philosophy

The system is constructed upon the following three fundamental principles:

### 1. Decoupling of OS (Core) and Templates (Purpose)
> **"Avoid embedding specific purposes directly into the OS core."**

This is the most critical rule of the system. Overloading the OS with specific instructions leads to a decline in precision. By maintaining a clean Core (OS) and utilizing "External Templates" for specific tasks, the system ensures peak performance at all times.

### 2. Precision Control via "Dynamic Gearing"
Building upon the autonomous task-difficulty assessment introduced in v13.4, v13.5-H integrates even more refined "COMPOSED" control. The AI analyzes requirements in real-time to switch between rapid responses and heavy logical reasoning, balancing a seamless user experience with unerring output.

### 3. Flexibility and Robust Precision
We value "Flexibility," allowing the AI to think freely without overly rigid constraints. However, during critical operations, the system automatically triggers a **"Fail-Safe Bias"**—an ultra-meticulous mode—to ensure robust results worthy of the TITAN designation.
