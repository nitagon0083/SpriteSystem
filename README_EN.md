# SpriteSystem OS v10.3 | NITAGON Logic Core

### 〜 A "Thinking OS" born from endless trial and error 〜

**SpriteSystem** is a system prompt architecture designed to transform Large Language Models (LLMs) into a functional "AI Operating System." 
Built upon extensive validation, its core purpose is to unlock the true latent potential of AI.

The latest **v10.3** introduces the concepts of "Self-Diagnostic" and "Logic Reload," achieving unprecedented precision and objectivity.

## ■ Design Philosophy: The Golden Ratio of Control and Versatility

Rather than blindly restricting the AI, this OS pursues a refined balance between **tight control** and **dynamic flexibility**.

1. **Separation of OS (Core) and Template (Task)**
   The OS remains a clean "Framework of Thought." By not hardcoding specific goals into the core, we preserve the AI's full potential. Highly versatile task-specific "Templates" are then attached externally.

2. **Self-Analysis via Objective Perspective**
   To suppress the AI's inherent "Affirmation Bias," the system integrates a process that evaluates itself from a detached, objective viewpoint, ensuring logical consistency in all outputs.

3. **Efficiency through Hybrid Operation**
   Strategically switch between two modes: "Flash" for daily dialogue and "Pro" for heavy-duty analysis. This optimizes resource usage while maintaining high accuracy.

## ■ Key Features of v10.3 (Advanced Logic)

* **PHASE 0: SELF-DIAGNOSTIC:** Before answering, the AI performs a self-check on its understanding of the instructions to prevent "logic drift" before it starts.
* **DRIFT DETECTION:** Automatically detects and warns of instruction loss or inconsistency during prolonged conversations.
* **RELOAD TRIGGER:** If the system becomes unstable, specific commands force a reset and reconstruction of the logical structure.
* **ADAPTIVE DIFF STRATEGY:** Automatically determines whether to "Replace All" or "Partially Update" based on the volume of changes, optimizing token efficiency.

## ■ [RELOAD] System Reload Sequence
When logic becomes cluttered, redefine the framework with the following process:

> **RELOAD TRIGGER:**
> 1. **Current State:** v10.3 Stable
> 2. **Logic Integrity:** Checking... [OK]
> 3. **Self-Diagnostic:** AI Advisor / Data Analyst / Prompt Engineer modes ready.
> *System framework locked to the latest state.*

## ■ Recommended Development Cycle

1. **[Specialization] Experimentation with Flash Mode:** Fine-tune the AI's direction and find the path to the right answer.
2. **[Execution] High-Level Output with Pro Mode:** Transition to this mode for phases requiring deep analysis or precise code generation to complete heavy tasks.
3. **[Refinement] Finishing with Delta Updates:** Repeat minor adjustments, replacing only the necessary parts until satisfied.
4. **[Assetization] Save as Template:** Save successful processes as "Templates." Replicate peak performance instantly for future tasks.

## ■ Compatibility
While this system is optimized for the Gemini 3.0 series, its logical core is designed to be versatile. It should likely work with other high-end models (such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5), but for the best results, I recommend fine-tuning it to match each model's specific characteristics.

## ■ Support

Thank you for your interest in SpriteSystem.

Currently, I am continuing to update this project while undergoing treatment for cancer. 
If this system has helped you improve your efficiency and you would like to support my work, "buying me a coffee" would be a great encouragement.

Any support received will be used carefully to cover medical expenses and maintain the development environment. Simply having you use this system brings me great joy as a developer.
