# SpriteSystem

A system prompt designed to function as an "AI Operating System" for Google Gemini.

This is an experimental project developed individually by a beginner, with the goal of maximizing the inherent capabilities of AI.

---

## 🌌 Design Philosophy

This system is built upon three core concepts:

### 1. Separation of OS (Core) and Template (Task)
**"Never clutter the OS itself with specific task goals."**
This is the most critical rule of this system.

Overloading the OS with instructions leads to a drop in precision. By keeping the core (OS) clean and utilizing "external templates" for each task, we maintain high performance.

### 2. Co-creation of Templates through Dialogue
Rather than just giving pre-made instructions, you work with the OS through dialogue to build the ideal "instruction set (template)" for your specific goal at that moment.

### 3. Ensuring Precision through Flexible "Room" (Play)
Stiff, overly rigid instructions can cause the AI to lose its flexibility. By intentionally allowing for "looseness" or "room to breathe," we draw out the most optimal responses for any given situation.

## ✅ Proven Results & Evolution Process

The developer has verified the practicality of this system in the following tasks.
Precision is continuously refined through a **"Feedback Loop"** that returns insights gained in practice back into the OS.

#### 【Verified Task List】
| Category | Specific Applications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Building high-precision instructions optimized for various generative AIs. |
| **Data Analysis** | Organizing/analyzing complex information and deriving conclusions. |
| **Discussion** | Deep-diving into ideas and debating from multifaceted perspectives. |
| **Writing** | Authoring logical documents, reports, and articles. |
| **App Development** | Support for design, logic building, and coding. |

#### 【Evolution Mechanism】
1. **Practice:** Execute the above tasks on SpriteSystem.
2. **Analysis:** Evaluate the AI's response and output accuracy.
3. **Feedback:** Incorporate findings back into the OS configuration for optimization.

## 📦 Public Files

| File Name | Recommended Use | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SpriteSystem_Pro.md** | Advanced Tasks | Logical thinking, precision design, development, etc. |
| **SpriteSystem_Flash.md** | Daily Tasks | Response speed, token efficiency, ease of use. |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Setup:** Copy and configure the contents of either `Pro` or `Flash`.
2. **Launch:** Once the OS is loaded, tell it what you want to achieve.
3. **Operation:** **Do not modify the OS itself.** Instead, create and execute templates through dialogue.

---

## ■ Compatibility
This system is optimized for the Gemini 3.0 series. While the logical structure is designed to be versatile and should likely work with other high-end models (such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5), fine-tuning to match each model's specific characteristics is recommended for best results.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* **Guarantee:** As this is an experimental project, successful operation is not guaranteed.
* **Accuracy:** All content generated must be verified by a human.
* **Responsibility:** The developer assumes no responsibility for any damages resulting from the use of this system.

## ■ Support

Thank you for your interest in SpriteSystem.

Currently, I am continuing to update this project while undergoing treatment for cancer. 
If this system has helped you improve your efficiency and you would like to support my work, "buying me a coffee" would be a great encouragement.

Any support received will be used carefully to cover medical expenses and maintain the development environment. Simply having you use this system brings me great joy as a developer.
