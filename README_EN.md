# SpriteSystem

System prompt designed to function as an "AI-native OS" for Google Gemini.

This is an experimental project developed by an individual creator, aiming to push the boundaries of AI's logical processing and cognitive capabilities.

## 🌌 Core Philosophy

SpriteSystem is built upon three fundamental architectural principles:

### 1. Separation of OS (Kernel) and Template (App)
> **"Never bloat the OS with specific task instructions."**

This is the most critical rule. Overloading the system prompt degrades reasoning accuracy. By keeping the Base OS (Kernel) clean and using "External Templates" for specific tasks, we maintain peak performance at all times.

### 2. Dynamic Gearing
Introduced in v13.4, the **Dynamic Gear Dispatcher** allows the AI to autonomously assess the complexity of the input.
- **Low-Tier:** Rapid response for simple greetings or casual chat.
- **High-Tier:** Deep cognitive processing for complex logic, coding, or data analysis.
This "seamless shifting" ensures both speed and power.

### 3. Balanced Flexibility (Fail-Safe Bias)
We value "Flexibility" to allow the AI to think creatively. However, for critical tasks (e.g., code debugging), the system automatically triggers a **"Fail-Safe Bias"**—forcing high-precision mode to ensure reliability and zero-loss of information.

## ✅ Verified Capabilities

Developed through a continuous **"Feedback Loop"** based on real-world professional tasks:

| Category | Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced Prompt Engineering** | Building high-density instruction sets for various LLMs. |
| **Data & Logic Analysis** | Organizing complex information and deriving logical conclusions. |
| **Multilayered Discussion** | Deep-diving into ideas from diverse perspectives. |
| **Technical Writing** | Drafting precise documents based on the "Sudoku Standard." |
| **Software Development** | Architectural design, logic building, and code refactoring. |

## ⚠️ Important Note for Global Users

**This OS is specifically optimized for the Japanese Language Circuit.**

The internal logic gates and output protocols are tuned to maximize the nuance and structural precision of Japanese. If you wish to use it in other languages (e.g., English), please note:
1. You may need to modify the `[GATEKEEPER]` and `Output Circuit` settings within the `.md` files to your preferred language.
2. The "logic-first" approach remains effective, but the phrasing may carry Japanese linguistic structures.

## 📦 Repository Files

Fetch the latest versions from the `/OS` directory:

* **[SpriteSystem_Pro.md](./OS/SpriteSystem_Pro.md)**
    * **Recommended for**: Complex tasks (Refined logic, architecture, deep debugging).
    * **Features**: Powered by v13.4 [TITAN]. Balanced for speed and ultimate reasoning.
* **[SpriteSystem_Flash.md](./OS/SpriteSystem_Flash.md)**
    * **Recommended for**: Daily tasks (Speed, token efficiency, lightweight chat).
    * **Features**: Focused on rapid response and ease of use.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Deploy:** Copy the code from `Pro` or `Flash` and set it as your AI's System Instructions.
2. **Boot:** Once the OS is loaded, simply state your task.
3. **Operate:** **Do not modify the OS code during the session.** Instead, co-create task-specific "Templates" through dialogue with the AI.

## ■ Support / Donation

The development of SpriteSystem is a passion project by an author currently fighting cancer. 

If this system has empowered your creativity and you wish to support the ongoing development and treatment, a small "coffee" would be deeply appreciated. Your support helps maintain the development environment and medical expenses.
