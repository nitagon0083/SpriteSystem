# SpriteSystem

A system prompt architecture designed to transform Google Gemini into a "Logical OS for AI."

This is an experimental project developed by a solo creator. It aims to maximize the inherent capabilities of AI to their fullest potential.

## 🌌 Design Philosophy

> **Note: This system is optimized for processing in Japanese.**
> While multilingual input is supported, the internal logic and response structures are tuned for peak performance within a Japanese language environment.

This system is built upon the following three core principles:

### 1. Decoupling of OS (Core) and Template (Objective)
> **"Do not bloat the OS itself with specific task-oriented instructions."**

This is the most critical rule of the system. Overloading the OS with specific instructions leads to a decline in precision. By keeping the core (OS) clean and utilizing "external templates" for each task, the system maintains high-level performance.

### 2. Comfort through "Dynamic Gearing"
A new feature introduced in v13.4. The AI autonomously determines the complexity of the task—whether it is a simple greeting or a complex technical problem. By switching "gears" to provide quick answers for simple tasks and deep, concentrated logic for difficult ones, it ensures a stress-free user experience.

### 3. Flexibility and Precision Balance
The system values "flexibility," allowing the AI to think freely without being overly constrained by rigid instructions. However, for critical tasks (e.g., code debugging), the AI automatically switches to a high-precision mode via the **"Fail-Safe Bias,"** ensuring the most appropriate response for the situation.

## ✅ Proven Reliability & Evolutionary Process

The developer has verified the practical utility of the system through the following tasks. Through a **"Feedback Loop"** that integrates insights gained from real-world usage back into the OS, its precision continues to be refined.

| Category | Specific Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced Prompt Design** | Construction of high-density instructions optimized for various generative AIs |
| **Data Analysis** | Organization and analysis of complex information, and derivation of conclusions |
| **Discussion** | Deep-dive exploration of ideas and multi-perspective discussions |
| **Document Creation** | Writing of logical documents, reports, and articles |
| **App Development** | Support for architectural design, logic construction, and coding |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Deployment**: Copy the code from `Pro` or `Flash` via the links above and set it in your AI's system prompt or equivalent.
2. **Boot**: Once the OS is loaded, convey what you want to achieve.
3. **Operation**: **Do not modify the OS itself**; instead, create and execute templates through interaction.

## ■ Support

The development of SpriteSystem is a project fueled by passion, created during the limited time the author has while fighting cancer.

If you find this system useful and feel inclined to support my journey, a contribution equivalent to a cup of coffee would be a tremendous encouragement. Any support received will be carefully used for medical expenses and maintaining the development environment.
