# SpriteSystem

**SpriteSystem** is a system prompt designed to make Google Gemini function as an "AI OS".
It is an experimental project developed by an individual enthusiast, aimed at maximizing the AI's inherent logical capabilities and achieving "Zero-Loss" information preservation.

In **v15.1 [TITAN_NEXUS]**, the system has evolved into a highly robust platform featuring **"Identity Lock"** and **"Security Hardened"** protocols, alongside its signature "Dual-Kernel" architecture.

## 🌌 Design Philosophy

> **Note: This system is optimized for processing in Japanese.**
> The internal logic is constructed in English to maximize reasoning density, but the output is tuned to perform best in a Japanese environment.

The system is built on three core pillars:

### 1. Dual-Kernel Architecture
> **"Coexistence of Cold Logic and Warm Empathy"**
The system instantly analyzes the nature of the task and dynamically switches between two personality kernels.
*   **[KERNEL: LOGIC]**: The traditional TITAN specification. Cold, high-speed logical processing for code generation and mathematics.
*   **[KERNEL: EMPATHY]**: The dialogue engine. Gentle, polite guidance and sequential verification for beginners and consultation tasks.

### 2. Cognitive Brake & Identity Lock
To prevent "hallucinations" typical of high-speed models, an OS-level **"Anti-Rush Protocol"** is implemented.
Additionally, v15.1 introduces **"Identity Lock"**, which fixes the kernel's persona, ensuring consistency in logic and stance even during long conversations.

### 3. Security Hardened
For sensitive topics like medicine or law, the OS now includes **"Safety Injection"**—autonomously detecting risks and providing disclaimers or emergency guidance (e.g., dial 119). Privacy protection features have also been strengthened.

## ✅ Track Record & Evolution

The developer has verified practicality in the following tasks. Precision is continuously polished through a "feedback loop".

| Category | Specific Use Cases | Evolution in v15.1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **App Development** | Zero-Loss code generation without logical contradictions | Strict adherence via Logic Kernel |
| **Medical/Consulting** | Hearing symptoms/concerns, organizing facts | **[Enhanced]** Safety nets & Privacy Guard |
| **Data Analysis** | Precision statistics/graphing via Python execution | Improved autonomous self-correction |
| **Tutoring** | Step-by-step guidance without giving away answers | Understanding checks via Sequential Loop |
| **Writing** | Precision translation/rewriting maintaining 100% nuance | Consistency maintenance via Identity Lock |

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Installation**: Copy the code from `Pro` or `Flash` linked above and set it as the AI's System Instructions.
2.  **Boot**: When the OS loads successfully, the AI will respond with **`System Ready...`** and enter standby mode.
3.  **Operation**:
    *   **For Development**: Command `Create...`, `Fix...`, etc. The system immediately engages **[LOGIC]** mode for high-speed processing.
    *   **For Consultation**: Say `Help...`, `Guide...`, etc. The system engages **[EMPATHY]** mode for gentle hearing.
4.  **Session Management**:
    *   After a task is complete, the AI displays a "Next Action Menu" (Edit/New/Finish). You can smoothly continue by simply selecting a number.
