# SpriteSystem OS v10.3 | NITAGON Logic Core

### 〜Thinking OS: Born from Trial and Error〜

**SpriteSystem** is a system prompt architecture designed to make Large Language Models (LLMs) function as an "AI OS." 
It has been built through extensive testing to maximize the inherent potential of AI.

The latest **v10.3** introduces Self-Diagnostic and Reload concepts, achieving higher precision and objectivity.

## ■ Design Philosophy: The Golden Ratio of Control and Flexibility

This OS seeks the perfect balance between "Control" and "Flexibility" rather than simply restricting the AI.

1. **Separation of OS (Core) and Template (Target)**
   The OS maintains a clean "Framework of Thought." By not cluttering it with specific tasks, we preserve the AI's full potential. Specific functions are added via external "Templates."

2. **Self-Analysis through Objective Perspective**
   To suppress "Affirmation Bias," the system incorporates a process for objective self-evaluation, ensuring logical consistency in outputs.

3. **Efficiency through Hybrid Operation**
   Strategically switch between "Flash mode" for daily interactions and "Pro mode" for heavy-duty analysis, optimizing resources while maintaining high precision.

## ■ Key Features of v10.3 (Advanced Logic)

* **PHASE 0: SELF-DIAGNOSTIC:** Before responding, the AI self-checks its understanding of instructions to prevent logical "drift."
* **DRIFT DETECTION:** Automatically detects and warns of instruction loss or logic shifts during long conversations.
* **RELOAD TRIGGER:** Force-resets and rebuilds the logical structure using specific commands if the system becomes unstable.
* **ADAPTIVE DIFF STRATEGY:** Automatically determines between "Full Replacement" and "Partial Edit" based on the volume of changes to optimize token efficiency.

## ■ [RELOAD] System Reload Sequence
When logic becomes complex, the following process redefines the thinking framework.

> **RELOAD TRIGGER:**
> 1. **Current State:** v10.3 Stable
> 2. **Logic Integrity:** Checking... [OK]
> 3. **Self-Diagnostic:** AI Advisor / Data Analyst / Prompt Engineer modes ready.
> Thinking framework re-initialized and fixed to the latest state.

## ■ Recommended Development Cycle

1. **[Specialize] Trial and Error in Flash Mode**
   Narrow down the AI's focus to find the right path for your goal.
2. **[Execute] High-Quality Output in Pro Mode**
   Switch to Pro mode for phases requiring deep analysis or precise code generation.
3. **[Adjust] Refinement via Differential Updates**
   Fine-tune only the necessary parts until you are satisfied with the result.
4. **[Assetize] Save as Template**
   Save successful processes as "Templates" to reproduce peak precision instantly.

## ■ Support

Thank you for your interest in SpriteSystem.

Currently, I am continuing to update this project while undergoing treatment for cancer. 
If you find this system useful and would like to support my work, "buying me a coffee" would be greatly appreciated.

All support received will be used for medical expenses and maintaining the development environment. I'm just glad to see it being put to use.
